          
             Door Sensor Embeded C project is used inorder to indicate the door Open or  Close by glowing the Led.If the Door is Open Led will ON else Led will be in OFF condition.

ATMEL STUDIO-

•	Software tool used for coding is Atmel studio and atmega 328 processor is used inorder to compile and run the program.

•	In atmel studio first the new project is created and the microcontroller is selected inorder to done the project.

•	Embede C coding is done then we should save the file after that we should compile and build the file in order to run in simulide.

SIMULIDE-

•	SIMULIDE is used inorder for simulation of the project.

•	In simulide atmega328 microcontroller is used and it includes components like voltmeter,switch,led,resistor to run the project and check the result.

•	After the simulation setup the microcontroller is loaded with firmware to open the code hexa file and the project is executed and the result is obtained.
